# Introduction to ROS
think of a **`robot`** that can help around the house. You've got a motor for the `vacuum attachment`, a camera to avoid bumping into furniture, and some sensors to help it `navigate`. But here's the problem: how do you get all these pieces to talk to each other?

Writing all the code from scratch to make the motor work with the camera and sensors would take forever, and it would be a mess! That's where `ROS` comes in. Imagine ROS like a universal translator for your robot parts. It lets the motor understand what the camera "sees" and the sensors "feel," so they can all work together. With ROS, you can focus on the cool stuff, like teaching your robot to clean under the couch, instead of wrestling with complicated code.

### What is ROS ?
* **`ROS`** is an open-source `robot operating system`.
* A set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications that work across a wide variety of robotic platforms
* Originally developed in 2007 at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
* Laboratory and development continued at Willow Garage
* Since 2013 managed by `OSRF` (Open Source Robotics Foundation)

### ROS Distributions:
like any pltaform it has version there is **`ROS`** distributions each distributions has its features and tools you choose the distribution depends on your needs

# ROS Architecture and Components

* `ROS` (Robot Operating System) is a `framework` widely used for developing robot software.
* It's not a traditional operating system, but rather a set of software frameworks for robot software development. It provides various tools and libraries that help in building, visualizing, and controlling robotic systems.
ROS (Robot Operating System) is a framework for developing robot software.
* It consists of three levels of concepts: the `Filesystem level`, the `Computation Graph level`, and the `Community level1`.

## A -  Filesystem Level

At the Filesystem Level, ROS resources are organized on disk as follows:

* **`Packages`**: These are the fundamental units for organizing software within ROS. Each package contains essential elements such as ROS nodes, libraries, configuration files, and other resources crucial for robot applications. A package adheres to a predefined structure and includes metadata provided by a `package.xml` file.

* **`Metapackages`**: These special packages serve as containers for grouping related packages. They play a key role in defining dependencies and facilitating software distribution. For instance, the `ros_base` metapackage encompasses core ROS packages.

* **`Message Types`**: These define the structure of data exchanged between ROS nodes. Stored in `.msg` files within a package's `msg` directory, message types play a critical role in communication between nodes.

* **`Service Types`**: These define the structure of requests and responses for services offered by ROS nodes. Stored in `.srv` files within a package's `srv` directory, service types enable the provision of specific functionalities within a ROS system.

* **`Action Types`**: These define the structure of goals, feedback, and results for actions executed by ROS nodes. Stored in `.action` files within a package's `action` directory, action types facilitate the execution of complex tasks within a ROS environment.

## B - ROS Workspaces and ROS Packages

- ### ROS Workspaces

    ROS Workspace is a concept that helps organize your Robot Operating System (ROS) projects. Think of it as a designated folder where you manage related pieces of ROS code.

    The official name for workspaces in ROS is `catkin workspaces`.

    
    * ###   Creating a ROS Workspace

        You can **create** a **workspace** by open a terminal and execute the following commands:

        ```bash
        mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
        cd ~/catkin_ws/src
        catkin_init_workspace
        ```
        ---
    * ### Components of ROS Workspace

        A **Catkin ROS workspace** contains three main spaces:

        `src` : contains source code, this will be your main work folder.

        `devel` : contains setup files for the project ROS environment.

        `build` : contains the compiled binary files.

        <p align="center">

    ---
 
- ### ROS Packages

    ROS packages reside in the `src` space. In ROS, software is organised in ROS packages.

   *  ### Creating ROS package

        You can create a ROS package by open a terminal and execute the following commands:

        ```bash
        cd ~/catkin_ws/src
        catkin_init_workspace
        catkin_create_pkg arab_meetup_robot std_msgs rospy roscpp
        ```

    * ### Building ROS workspaces and ROS packages

        Once your workspace is set up, you can start building packages using the `catkin_make` command.

        ### catkin_make

        `catkin_make` builds all packages in the workspace.

        ```bash
        cd ~/catkin_ws
        catkin_make
        ```

    * #### A ROS package typically contains the following things:

        - **`CMakeList.txt`** &rarr; includes directives for finding dependencies, configuring build options, and defining targets
            The main `CMake` file to build the package
            Calls catkin-specific functions/macros

            * `Read` the package.xml
            * find other catkin packages to access libraries / include directories
            * export items for other packages depending on yours


                <p align="center">
                <img src="images/cmakelist.png"> 


        - **`package.xml`** &rarr; provides metadata about the package, including its name, version, description, dependencies, maintainers, and licensing information.
                The package.xml file defines the properties of the
            package:

            * Package name &rarr; `first_package`
            * Version number &rarr; `V.0.1`
            * Authors &rarr; `Mohamed Elshamy`
            * Dependencies on other packages &rarr; `std_msgs, roscpp`

## C - Computation Graph Level

The Computation Graph level describes the communication between ROS processes that are running on one or more machines. The main concepts are:



<p align="center">
<img src="images/ROS concept.png">


- **Master** : The Master is a central process that provides name and registration services for the nodes in the ROS system. It allows nodes to find and communicate with each other. The Master also provides a Parameter Server, which is a shared dictionary of key-value pairs that nodes can access and modify.

- **Nodes** : Nodes are `executable` programs that perform computation and communicate with each other using ROS topics, services, actions, or parameters. Nodes can be written in different languages, such as Python, C++, or Lisp.

-  **Topics** : Topics are named buses that nodes can use to exchange messages. A node can publish messages to a topic or subscribe to messages from a topic. Topics are `anonymous` and `asynchronous`, meaning that the publisher and subscriber do not need to know each other or wait for each other.

- **Services**: Services are named pairs of request and response messages that nodes can use to invoke `synchronous` remote procedure calls. A node can offer a service or call a service. Services are persistent and `synchronous`, meaning that the service provider and the service client need to be available and `wait` for each other.

- **Actions**: Actions are named triples of `goal`, `feedback`, and `result` messages that nodes can use to perform long-running tasks. A node can provide an action or execute an action. Actions are persistent and `asynchronous`, meaning that the action provider and the action client can communicate and monitor the progress of the task without blocking each other.





# Basic ROS Commands and Tools

ROS (Robot Operating System) is a framework for developing robot software. It provides a set of tools and libraries that simplify creating complex and robust robot behavior across various robotic platforms. In this tutorial, we will learn some of the most common and useful ROS commands and tools that can help us interact with ROS nodes, topics, services, parameters, and more.

- ## ROS Master
    Before running any ROS nodes, we should start ROS Master and the ROS parameter server. We can start ROS Master and the ROS parameter server using a single command called `roscore`, which will start the following programs
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/rosmaster.png">
    

- ## ROS Nodes

    Nodes are executable programs that perform computation and communicate with each other using ROS topics, services, actions, or parameters. Nodes can be written in different languages, such as Python, C++, or Lisp. To manage and inspect nodes, we can use the following commands:

    `rosnode list` &rarr; This command lists the names of all the active nodes in the ROS system.

    `rosnode info` &rarr; This command prints information about a specific node, such as its publications, subscriptions, services, and connections.

    `rosnode ping` &rarr; This command tests the connectivity to a node by sending ping requests and measuring the response time.

    `rosnode kill` &rarr; This command terminates a node by sending a shutdown request.

- ## ROS Topics

    Topics are named buses that nodes can use to exchange messages. A node can publish messages to a topic or subscribe to messages from a topic. Topics are anonymous and asynchronous, meaning that the publisher and subscriber do not need to know each other or wait for each other. To manage and inspect topics, we can use the following commands:

    - **`rostopic list`** &rarr; This command lists the names of all the active topics in the ROS system.

    - **`rostopic info`** &rarr; This command prints information about a specific topic, such as its type, publishers, and subscribers.

    - **`rostopic echo`** &rarr; This command prints the messages being sent on a topic to the screen.

    - **`rostopic pub`** &rarr; This command publishes a message of a given type and arguments to a topic from the command line.

    - **`rostopic hz`** &rarr; This command measures the rate of messages being published on a topic.

- ## ROS Services

    Services are named pairs of request and response messages that nodes can use to invoke synchronous remote procedure calls. A node can offer a service or call a service. Services are persistent and synchronous, meaning that the service provider and the service client need to be available and wait for each other. To manage and inspect services, we can use the following commands:

    - **`rosservice list`** &rarr; This command lists the names of all the active services in the ROS system.

    - **`rosservice info`** &rarr; This command prints information about a specific service, such as its type, provider, and callers.

    - **`rosservice call`** &rarr; This command calls a service with the given arguments and prints the response.

    - **`rosservice type`** &rarr; This command prints the type of the request and response messages of a service.

    <p align="center">
    <img src="images/1.png">

- ## ROS Parameters

    Parameters are named values that nodes can use to store and retrieve configuration data. Parameters are stored on a central server called the Parameter Server, which is part of the ROS Master. Parameters can have different types, such as strings, integers, floats, booleans, arrays, or dictionaries. To manage and inspect parameters, we can use the following commands:

    - **`rosparam list`** &rarr; This command lists the names of all the parameters in the ROS system.

    - **`rosparam get`** &rarr; This command prints the value of a specific parameter or a namespace of parameters.

    - **`rosparam set`** &rarr; This command sets the value of a parameter or a namespace of parameters.

    - **`rosparam dump`** &rarr; This command dumps all the parameters to a YAML file.

    - **`rosparam load`** &rarr; This command loads all the parameters from a YAML file.

- # ROS Tools

    In addition to the command-line tools, ROS also provides graphical tools that can help us visualize, debug, and analyze ROS data. Some of the most popular ROS tools are:

    - **`roscore`** &rarr; The basis nodes and programs for ROS-based systems. A roscore must be running for ROS nodes to communicate.
        <p align="center">
        <img src="images/roscore.png"> 


    - **`rosrun`** &rarr; Runs a ROS package’s executable with minimal typing.

    - **`rqt`** &rarr; rqt is a Qt-based framework that integrates various ROS tools into a single interface. It allows us to create customized GUIs using plugins, such as rqt_graph, rqt_console, rqt_plot, rqt_image_view, and more.

        <p align="center">
        <img src="images/rqt.png"> 

    - **`rviz`** &rarr; rviz is a 3D visualization tool that can display sensor data, robot models, navigation maps, and more. It allows us to interact with the robot and the environment using interactive markers, tools, and panels.

        <p align="center">
        <img src="images/rviz.png"> 

    - **`rosbag`** &rarr; rosbag is a tool that can record and playback ROS message data. It allows us to store and analyze ROS data offline, such as sensor readings, robot poses, images, and more.

    - **`roslaunch`** &rarr; roslaunch is a tool that can start multiple nodes at once using launch files. It allows us to configure and manage complex ROS systems, such as setting parameters, remapping topics, and launching other launch files.



# Community Level

The Community level encompasses the tools and conventions for sharing and distributing ROS software. The main concepts are:

* **Repositories**: Repositories are collections of packages that share a common version control system, such as Git or SVN. Repositories can be hosted on platforms such as GitHub or Bitbucket, and can be indexed by ROS tools for easy access.

* **Distributions**: Distributions are collections of packages that are tested and released together, such as ROS Kinetic or ROS Melodic. Distributions have a fixed release cycle and support policy, and can be installed from pre-built binaries or source code.

* **[ROS Index](https://index.ros.org/)**: ROS Index is a web portal that provides information and documentation for ROS packages, repositories, and distributions. It also allows users to search, browse, and rate ROS software.

* **[ROS Wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/Documentation)**: ROS Wiki is a collaborative website that hosts tutorials, guides, and specifications for ROS. It also serves as a platform for community feedback and discussion.

* **[Stack exchange](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/)**: Stack exchange is a question-and-answer site that helps users solve problems and learn more about ROS. It also fosters a culture of helping and learning within the ROS community.
